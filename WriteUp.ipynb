Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",

    "Before applying any additional techniques to data i decided to only apply normalization and run a training epoch to see the results and whether i can get satisfactory results or not. So, i have normalized the image data by subtracting and dividing 128 to each pixel data. That way, now i have values between -1 and 1 that i can feed these values into my neural network, else, it is obvious that original pixel values are too big to feed into a neural network.\n",

Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps.
